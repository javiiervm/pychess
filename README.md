## Workflow
This program allows you to play chess on your PC locally with a friend, with a round system so you move your pieces in turns, following the classic chess workflow.

* When opened, the program displays the board automatically with all the pieces ready, black goes up and white goes down. White starts.

  </div>

* When clicking or touching a piece, the board will automatically display the squares to which it can be moved.

* Only movements that can save the king are allowed when it is in danger. This is checked automatically by the program.

## Future updates and pending work
* Add support for iOS.
* Movement counter when the king is the last piece alive to allow ties.
* When a Pawn reaches the end of the board, allow the player to choose between Queen, Rook, Bishop and Knight instead of turning it into Queen by default.
* Progress saver to continue the game later.
* Online connection to play with friends that are far away!
* New game modes!
